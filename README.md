Hello there. I'm Luca06Luwa. Founder and CEO of Abyssal Studios.
---

I have been in the coding space for a few years now and I's still just as bad as I was when I began.

---
### Stuff I’m currently working on:

- Some small shitty projects that don't work. (Most of the time).

---
### Archived projects or projects that I don't want to work on anymore:

- Converting the written Linux Guides into an automated shell script.

- Making ani-cli to scape services that AniMixPlay used to use.

- Website (least of my worries).

---
### Finished Projects:

- Converting the Linux Guides to the markdown format to replace the original txt based format.

- Successfully ported Clone Hero to the scoop package manager. If you want to install the latest build of Clone Hero, just run the following commands:

```sh
scoop bucket add games
scoop install clonehero
```

### Coding Languages/tools I know. (Or at least have tried to learn):
