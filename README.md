Hello there. I'm Luna. Founder, CEO and only member of LunaProductions.
---

I have been in the programming and FOSS community for a few years now and I'm still just as bad as I was when I started.

---
### Stuff Iâ€™m currently working on:

- A minecraft mod loader that doesn't care if it's forge or fabric. (MCModAPI)

- Website (least of my worries).

- Requested: Building a motion tracker thats better than apples one. (God help me)

- Setting up a self hosted Git server for some future projects. (This github account will not be going away after it's setup).

- Rewriting ani-cli in c or c++. (God help me).

- Some small shitty projects that don't work. (Most of the time).

---
### Archived projects or projects that I don't want to work on anymore:

- Converting the written Linux Guides into an automated shell script.

---
### Finished Projects:

- Converting the Linux Guides to the markdown format to replace the original txt based format.

- Successfully ported Clone Hero to the scoop package manager. If you want to install the latest build of Clone Hero, just run the following commands:

```
scoop bucket add games
scoop install clonehero
```

### Coding Languages/tools I know. (Or at least have tried to learn):
