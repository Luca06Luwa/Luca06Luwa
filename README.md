Hello there. I'm Luca06Luwa. Founder and CEO of Abyssal Studios.
---

I have been a working on code for a few years now and I'm still terrible.

I also have my very own website [Insert URL Here] and a discord server [Insert Invite Code Here].

---
### Stuff Iâ€™m currently working on:

- Website

- Porting Clone Hero PTB to the scoop package manager (will take time)

- Other small shitty projects that don't work

---
### Archived projects or projects that I don't want to work on anymore:

- Clone Hero Control Panel

---
### Finished Projects:

- Uploaded the guide I use to install Arch Linux and setup QEMU through KVM

- Successfully ported Clone Hero to the scoop package manager. If you want to install Clone Hero v0.23.2.2 just use the following commands:

```sh
scoop bucket add games
scoop install clonehero
```

### Coding Languages/tools I know. (Or at least have tried to learn.):
