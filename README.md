Hello there. I'm Lara. Founder, CEO and only member of LunaProductions.

I have been active in the programming and FOSS community for a few years now and I'm still just as bad as I was when I started writing code.

Announcement:<br>Won't be doing much on here after patch 26 of my arch install guide is complete. Currently studying for a Cyber Secrity degree.

---
### Stuff Iâ€™m currently working on:

- A uninstaller for minecraft mod loaders and invasive mods.

- Website (least of my worries).

- Some small shitty projects that don't work. (Most of the time).

---
### Archived projects or projects that I don't want to work on anymore:

- Converting the written Linux Guides into an automated shell script.

- Requested: Building a motion tracker thats better than apples one. (God help me)

- Setting up a self hosted Git server for some future projects. (This github account will not be going away after it's setup, if anything I will mirror a lot of the stuff to github for convinience).

- Rewriting ani-cli in c or c++. (God help me).

- A minecraft mod loader that doesn't care if it's forge or fabric. (MCModAPI)
  
---
### Finished Projects:

- Converting the Linux Guides to the markdown format to replace the original txt based format.

- Rebuilding Ree you jynx build environment for personal builds of 1.1.1403 (no I will not give it to you, that's bad)

- Successfully ported Clone Hero to the scoop package manager. If you want to install the latest stable build of Clone Hero, just run the following commands:

```
scoop bucket add games
scoop install clonehero
```
