Hello there. I'm Luca06Luwa. Founder and CEO of Abyssal Studios.
---

I have been a working on code for a few years now and I'm still terrible at coding.

---
### Stuff Iâ€™m currently working on:

- Converting the Linux Guides to the cleaner looking format md to replace the txt format

- Other small shitty projects that don't work. (Most of the time).

---
### Archived projects or projects that I don't want to work on anymore:

- Clone Hero Control Panel (Made redundent by the upstream devs and by me adding CH to the scoop package manager).

- Porting Clone Hero v1.0.0.4080-final to the scoop package manager (Didn't want to work out installers).

- Packaging Frost Softwares programs to the scoop package manager (Didn't want to deal with it).

- Writing up the Aroma CFW Guide for the Wii U Hacks Guide.

- Website (least of my worries).

---
### Finished Projects:

- Uploaded the guide I use to install Arch Linux and setup QEMU through KVM (At a paint where it no longer needs updates).

- Successfully ported Clone Hero Stable to the scoop package manager. (Only did it because I thought it was a good idea). If you want to install Clone Hero v0.23.2.2 just use the following commands:

```sh
scoop bucket add games
scoop install clonehero
```

### Coding Languages/tools I know. (Or at least have tried to learn):
